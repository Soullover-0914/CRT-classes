After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.\n",

Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.\n",

Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellanâ€™s men died of starvation and disease.\n",

Vardha calls upon Deva to return and help him navigate the turmoil. Deva, who has been living a secluded life in Assam, agrees to come back, but his return is met with hostility.
